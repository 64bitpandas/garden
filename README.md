> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Welcome to the [seventh](https://garden.bencuan.me/about/the-history-of-bencuan-me) iteration of my [personal website](https://bencuan.me)! The Garden is my current home on the internet, and aims to be a complete repository of my knowledge, thoughts, and ideas.
